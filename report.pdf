How I completed the the required tasks were pretty straightforward. I used the lecture provided by Mr. Ortega to implement the controls
for WASD. For the rotation, I used the mouse and only allowed camera rotation in the X or Y axis because it seemed that allowing the Z
axis would be to much movement. I used 0 to stop the ball with simple canceling of the torque values. For the levels, I was unable to 
build them as I hoped, because the modeling tool was striped from this iteration somehow. However, I used cubes and turned them altered
their sizes so that they would make good platforms with already implemented collisions. Showing a player winning or losing, I keep the lives
in the top left corner and when the lives are 0 then the Lose widget will popup on the screen. Same goes for when the player completes level 5.
There is also a health bar apart of the UI that is affected by the collectables in game. The collectables in game are the bomb, the health, and the coin
which all have sounds associated with them when they collide with the player. Each collectable affects the player differently, either altering their health
or adding to their score. If a player dies, by either taking too much damage or falling off of the map, they will respawn at the beginning of each level and
have to start over. The Obstacles are pretyy simple, don't fall off, and don't run into too many bombs. The hardest part for me to code was getting the respawn
to work with how I first started programming the game. So in turn I used a game instance and had to adjust how I destroyed the player and how I respawned them
and how I started a new level. Took a lot of time, even having to use a debugger, but it was all worth it in the end and made the code much cleaner.
