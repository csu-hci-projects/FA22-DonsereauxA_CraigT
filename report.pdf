The tasks that were completed were the creation of all five levels with rising difficulty.
There is a killzone under each map to kill the player when they fall off.(There is a bug where it only kills once.)
You can progress through each level and when you complete level 5 you go back to level 1.
There is not an implemented UI, Pause menu, start or stop game option or a failed game option.
These were not implemented because of conflict in communication and timing within the group. 
Tyler created collectables and a bomb object where when struct will send you back to the respawn point.
The player is able to rotate the camera around the character but this DOES NOT move the characters front.
Is this branch there is a moving object in level 5 however, object does not kill player. 
Overall the project is alittle over 50% done as it is missing a UI, Pause Menu, 2 controls (5,6), and bug fixes with collisions.
