## Gameplay
When loading the file, you will see a black screen. This is intentional. Simply run the program and the title screen will appear. On the title screen, either click into the window to then be able to select exit or start, or click into the window and press the start/stop game keys listed above. From there, all 5 levels should play in a row. Upon death, you will be brought back to the title screen. High scores persist within the session but not between sessions, to mimic a more arcade-like style where truly stopping the game (or pulling the plug) would reset the high score. 
Your goal is to get to the goal (indicated by a glowing circle) without running out of time. Collect coins to increase your score and time remaining, and bombs will remove 50% of your max time. The max time will changed based off the level. The level view at the start of every level as well as the glowing light is designed to help you locate where the goal is, because sometimes it is not as obvious from within the level.
